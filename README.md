# svelte-headless-datatable

Headless (UI-less) datatable component for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Motivation

Main goal for this library is to create fully featured datatable component, but without UI implementation. Component only consists of data and methods common to datatable. I hope, this could speed up develpment of datatable for someone, regardless of its design.

## Installation

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```sh
$ npm i svelte-headless-datatable
```

or with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
